bugs exists sigh
If you find a bug in pianocheetah (not unheard of),
 hopefully my debug listing will tell me where it happened.

Turn debugging on in the pianocheetah settings
 - there's a checkbox for <b>trace to dbg.txt</b>

 - you'll find it at /home/you/.var/app/app.shaz.pianocheetah/config/dbg.txt
