what is a pianocheetah ??

Hey man.  You remember guitar hero, right?
Playing the guitar wasn't real, but it was fun.
On drums it wasn't a game it was real :)
And keyboards - <b>super DUUUMB</b> !

I was working on a vanilla midi app when it came out, and I changed my ways
 real fast to make pianocheetah.

 - for keyboards and drums.  (midi ones)

 - song notes are converted to 10 max.  just fingers - no hand hopping.

 - notes are shown aligned to your fingers in a "normal people" notation.

 - you set the tempo and note velocities (feel).  the rest of the tracks
   follow <b>you</b>.

 - not a DAW!!  We're playing piano, not mixing.

Here's Clair de Lune.  Think you could play that?  Bet ya could.
Or you could play just the right hand - to the right of that red line.

The real song looks like this - No thanks!!  I'm just a human.
