what is a pianocheetah ??

Hey man.  You remember guitar hero, right?
Playing the guitar wasn't real, but it was fun.
For drums you were truly play drums.
And the keyboards - the <b>WORST</b> !

I was working on a midi sequencer when it came out, and I changed my ways
 real fast to make pianocheetah.

 - for keyboards and drums.  (non acoustic ones:)

 - song notes are converted to 10 max.  all fingers no hand hops.

 - notes are aligned to your fingers.  in a "normal people" notation.

 - you set the tempo and note velocities (feel).  the rest of the tracks
   follow <b>you</b>.

 - not a DAW!!  We're playing piano, not mixing.
