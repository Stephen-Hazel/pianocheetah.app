what is a pianocheetah ??
 - it's for playing a song on piano and drums.

 - and practicing.  playing and practicing are different.

 - shows notes in a <b>piano roll</b> format that's a little bit fancy.

 - you practice the piano parts and<br>
   the bass, drums and vocals sync to your tempo.

 - not a DAW!!  We're here to get a take, not to mix down.

 - getting a song into your head and fingers is the aim.
