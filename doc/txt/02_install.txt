Pick the directory to <b>-put-</b> the pianocheetah dir into.
(don't include "pianocheetah" part)

Then you'll have to wait around (sorry).

After that, MidiConfig will pop up:
<img src="img/midicfg.png">
Where you pick each midi device's name and type.

 - if your device type isn't there, just pick <b>default</b>

 - playing an input device will show it's events on the right (so you know it's
   ok)

 - click an output device in the list to hear middle c and a kick on it

 - scoot the devices so the best ones are at the top
   (favorite feel / best sound)

 - If a device is just extra or an output device makes no sound, just set the
   type to <b>OFF</b>

 - <b>syn</b> is a software synthesizer - pick it's audio device (top right)

When you close MidiConfig, PianoCheetah will pop up.

Install complete !
