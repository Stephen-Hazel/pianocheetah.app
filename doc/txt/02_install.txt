Let's get this thing installed !
Got <a pop href="https://shaz.app/linux"
 >linux</a> installed yet?  (don't be a scaredy cat:)

 - hit KDE's Discover or Gnome's Software

 - search: pianocheetah

 - click install

 - now it's in your start menu's <b>multimedia</b> menu

The first time you run PianoCheetah, you'll see...
<img src="img/oh_hi.png">
Pick the directory to <b>-put-</b> the pianocheetah dir into.
(don't include "pianocheetah" part)
<img src="img/pick.png">
Then you'll have to wait around (sorry).
<img src="img/wait.png">
After that, MidiConfig will pop up:
<img src="img/midicfg.png">
Where you pick each midi device's name and type.

I suggest "rockin88" for your piano.
I just name my drums "drum".
If a device doesn't make sound, give it a type of OFF in the output list.

When you close MidiConfig, PianoCheetah will finally pop up.

Time to pick a song - I'd suggest...

Play that baby!
Put your right hand thumb on middle C like...


Now, this is only a melody.
 you could play it for real without too much trouble.  But stick with me.

Let's set it up in easy mode:

 - pick the Lrn column of the Piano track so it's a green triangle.
   that's the track you'll play.

 - pick the Hand column and set it to R for right hand.

 - pick the Dev.Chan column so it's syn.  The built in softsynth.

 - pick the Sound column so it's Elec1_aria.
   Electric piano from the free Aria soundbank.

 - now click the ez button in the toolbar so it's hilighted.

 - now click on the toolbar ear/finger/brain button until it's on
   finger=hear.  (The others are play and practice)

 - ok!  press w to wipe any notes you hit accidentally.

 - press 1 to go back to bar 1.

 - and you'll be playing that song with your right hand
   never having to hop - easy !

Ok.  Let's go over what some of these crazy parts of the screen actually are...
