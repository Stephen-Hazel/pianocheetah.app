Time to pick a song - I'd suggest you doubleclick...

Play it :)
Put your right hand thumb on middle C like this.
Get comfy with that position - it's the <b>only</b> position.

Follow the little green dot with your fingers.  Play expressively.
This song is only a melody.
 You could play it for real no prob.  But stick with me.

If you want to concentrate on the notes, this toolbar icon
<img src="img/viewtrack.png">
will flip between showing you the <i>track controls</i> and showing you
 fullscreen notes.  A song has a track for each sound.
<img src="img/track.png">
 - <b>learn</b> can be clicked between
- empty to just hear it,
- triangle to play it,
- X to mute it (right click)

 - <b>hand</b> can be set to LH and RH.  4RH means middle C's octave.
   3LH means the octave below.
   A friend can play a duet with you on the other octaves.

 - <b>track</b> is the part like bass or vocals.

 - click <b>sound</b> to pick another.

 - <b>device/channel</b> picks the device to play it on.

Here's the toolbar

Hover the icons to see a tooltip.
 - click the ear/finger/brain icon until it's on finger=play.
   ear=listen and brain=practice.


Here's the help menu for keyboard shortcuts
Hit F1 to show it.  Hit Esc to hide it.

It shows the piano notes and keyboard keys to kick pianocheetah commands.

press 1 to go back to bar 1, for example.

Oh and piano keys need a <i>shift control</i>.
If you have a pedal or modwheel - move it to pop this:

and set one of your controls to <b>keyCmd</b>.

Change the keys in pianocheetah/device/keycmd.txt

THAT'S ENOUGH about that !!

My plan is to do further documentation of how this thing works with videos.
