lyrics into to your songs
<b>ok, I lied.</b>  Let's get some lyrics into those song files.

There are tons of lyrics websites out there.
 I started out with hilighting lyric syllables but that's a huge pain.
 If lyrics are in the midi file, they'll come into your .song file - no worries.
 But it's a huge pain to enter syllables in.

So lyrics are entered in per line.  Easy.

Just copy the text from one of those lyric websites into a text editor.

Click the (top left) checkmark icon.
 Check "bar to clipbd for lyrics".  That'll happen as the song ticks along.

Start the song playing.  Get your cursor to the start of the line.
 <i>Juuuust</i> before that lyric line starts, hit control-V to paste in the
 bar #.  And repeat for each line.

You could uncheck "copy bar to clipboard" now but it's no biggie.

Now get pianocheetah to a <i>different</i> song cuz we're gonna edit this .song
 and pianocheetah has to NOT have it.

Put
<b>Lyric:</b>
in the first line of the file.
 Save the file as lyric.txt in the song's directory for safekeeping.

Get the whole file to the clipboard.
 Open the .song file - it's just text.
 Find the
<b>DrumMap:</b>
line.  There may already be a Lyric: line - so replace that with your file.

Otherwise paste it just after the DrumMap: lines (Kick, etc, etc)

(pianocheetah will put those _ and / in - nevermind em)

Save.

Reload your song - BAM - it has lyrics now.
