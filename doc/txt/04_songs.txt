keeping your songs organized
Your songs go in that PianoCheetah directory you picked during install.

Don't keep every midi file in the universe here!
Keep those in a different directory to be searched.

PianoCheetah lists it's directory every time it runs.

it's got...


<h3>1_learning</h3>
songs you're learning right now (daily)


<h3>2_repertoire</h3>
songs you want to keep in your fingers (weekly on rotation)


<h3>3_done</h3>
songs you're done with but want to keep because of the loops and
 fingering you've setup.
So you can pick them back up another day.


<h3>4_queue</h3>
staging area for new songs you'll get to as you have time.
eventually they'll be moved to 1/2/3 above...


<h3>clip</h3>
parts of tracks that are weaved into songs
drum clips, bass patterns, arpeggios, chord changes, and styles.


<h3>device</h3>
 - your midi hardware configuration

 - all of syn's samples.  and you can add samples to syn :)
