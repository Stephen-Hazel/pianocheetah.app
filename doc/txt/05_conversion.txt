.midi .txt .song .wav .mod and stuff
PianoCheetah only likes .song files.

<h3>mid2song</h3>
If you load a midi file, that thing will be turned into a <b>.song</b> file
 because midi files are <b>way too hard for Steve to deal with !!!</b>

You can open a .song file with a text editor.  It's just text.

A song is actually a <b>directory of stuff</b>.
 - the directory is the song name

 - in the directory is an <b>a.mid</b> file - that's the source of your song

 - there's also an <b>a.song</b> file - that's what pianocheetah uses

 - if you want that song in wav format, you guessed it, <b>a.wav</b>

 - there can also be an <b>a.txt</b> file instead of the a.mid file

 - maybe you have a <b>.pdf</b> of the sheet music (to name a.pdf:)


I like to name my songs as <i>group_rating_title</i> where

 - <i>group</i> is the band, artist, etc

 - <i>rating</i> is <b>a b</b> or <b>c</b>.

 - <i>title</i> is the song title

 - <b>no spaces cuz linux</b> (use - or _ instead)

<b>a</b>=awesome (like and can listen to it over and over)

<b>b</b>=basic (like but only once, please)

<b>c</b>=crappy (but maybe the beat or chords are good)

Currently there is <b>no known way</b> to get the song back to midi.
 <b>YET !</b>  But there will be some day.


<h3>txt2song</h3>
PianoCheetah can also convert .txt => .song

I made it for when I only have sheet music - no midi.
It's so I can do the least amount of typing to get sheet music <b>IN</b>.

I'll document it some day (sorry).
There are examples in the pianocheetah/4_queue/_demo/txt dir


<h1>Song List dialog's toolbar</h1>
In here there are 4 icons that all look the same.
<i>(sometimes computer programmers get lazy.
 Hover over them and the tooltips will tell them apart.)</i>

The first one is...

<h3>MidiImport</h3>
The Search toolbar icon is for searching your big ole directory of midi files.
The results are put into a 4_queue/Found dir and converted to .song

But if you already have a directory of midi files picked out, then this is the
 toolbar icon you want.

 - pianocheetah will eat this dir - make sure it has a <i>good</i> dir name
   cuz that'll be it's name in 4_queue.  (Too keep it organized).

 - a dir is made under 4_queue/dirname/midifilename for each
   midi file.  And it's converted to .song format.

 - any non midi files are moved to a dir called _junk
   (like .txt files or .pdf or whatever else)


<h3>Song2Wav</h3>
Let's say you get a song just right.  And you have a good recording.
And you wanna put it on your phone.
Pick a song in the list and click this guy.
That'll make an a.wav file in that directory.
You can put that on your phone and your music player can play it.

You may want to convert it to .mp3 - ffmpeg will do that for ya.

Oh!  The song must be completely played with syn - no other synths !


<h3>Sfz2Syn</h3>
Syn comes with a pretty ok set of sounds.
I have to distribute <i>these ones</i> because they're in the public domain.
<i>(Microsoft's <b>Songsmith</b>  purchased an
 <b>ARIA</b> sound set from <b>Garritan</b>
 and put it into the public domain).</i>

But there are some missing general midi "instruments" and some of the sounds
 could use a little improvement.  (The piano - eh - not super perfect).

Pick a dir of .SFZ files with this guy.
And those sounds will be added to syn's sounds.
You can always delete a sound directory in the pianocheetah/device/syn/ dir.

 - there's a "soundset" directory on top of

 - "individual sound" directory on top of

 - a bunch of .WAV files for the different note ranges / velocity ranges of the
   sound


<h3>Mod2Song</h3>
If you know <a pop href="https://shaz.app/me">me</a>
 you know I loved old computers.
We used to have .mod files also known as "soundtracker" files.
They contain samples and note info to play a techno-y song of some sort.
So I wrote a converter so pianocheetah could play them via syn.

It takes the 8 bit samples in the .mod file and adds them to a syn soundset.
Then converts the notes to a .song file.

If you haaaappen to have old .mod files around you may like this thingy.
For example...  <b>leave the brain</b>  !!!
