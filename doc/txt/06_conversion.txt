 .midi .txt .song .wav .sfz and .mod
PianoCheetah mainly uses .song files
.mid files are too limited and messy

So i got these converters:
 - midi => song

 - text => song

 - song => wav

 - sfz => wav (for syn)

 - mod => song & wav
remember soundtracker mods?  cuz you're old like me? :)

<h3>In the song picker</h3>
 - you'll see those as toolbar icons.  Hover em to tell em apart :/
   For example, song2wav will make a.wav -
   Use ffmpeg to convert it to .mp3

 - Search - use this on your big ole directory of midi files.
   Results are put into 4_queue/found dir and converted to .song

 - Midi Import - use this if you already have a directory of midi files.
   Pianocheetah will eat this dir so make a backup.  Be sure the top dir has a
   <i>good</i> name cuz it'll go into 4_queue.

You can open a .song file in a text editor.  It's just text.
If you dig writing scripts, you could try quilting songs together.

<h3>A song is actually a directory</h3>
 - the directory is the song name

 - <b>a.mid</b> file is the source of your .song

 - <b>a.song</b> is the main deal that pianocheetah uses

 - an <b>a.txt</b> file can also make a.song - look in queue/_demo/_txt for
   examples

 - maybe you have an <b>a.pdf</b> of the sheet music to build a.txt with.
   then turn a.txt => a.song


<h3>i'm picky naming songs</h3>
That may come as no surprise.
I like  `bg0`group`_`bg1`rating`_`bg2`title`  where

`bg1`rating` is a b or c:
 - a=awesome (will listen to it over and over)

 - b=basic (only once, please)

 - c=crappy (but maybe the beat or chords are good)


<h3>Sfz2Syn</h3>
Syn comes with a pretty ok set of sounds.
 from Microsoft's <b>Songsmith</b> which purchased an
 <b>ARIA</b> sound set from <b>Garritan</b> and put it into the public domain.

But there are some missing general midi sounds and some are lame - LIKE PIANO !!

Pick a dir of .SFZ files.
Those sounds will be added to syn's sounds.
You can always delete a sound directory in the pianocheetah/device/syn/ dir.

 - there's a <b>soundset</b> directory on top of

 - <b>individual sound</b> directory on top of

 - a bunch of .WAV files for the different note ranges / velocity ranges


<h3>Mod2Song</h3>
On my beloved Amiga500 we had .mod files (<b>soundtracker</b> files).
 They contain samples and notes of a techno-y song.

This thing takes the 8 bit samples and adds them to a syn soundset.
 Then converts the notes to a .song file.

Check the 4_queue/_demo/_mod dir.
For example...  `bg9`leave the brain` !!!
