keeping your songs organized
Your songs go in that pianocheetah directory you picked during install.

Don't keep every midi file in the universe here !!
Keep those in a different directory to be searched.

pianocheetah should have only songs you DO play (or plan to play soon)

There are 4 main directories:


 - 1_learning
   songs you're learning right now (daily-ish)

 - 2_repertoire
   songs to keep in your fingers (on rotation weekly-ish)

 - 3_done
   song you're done with but want to keep because of the loops and
   notes you've made.  So you can pick them back up.

 - 4_queue
   staging area for new songs you'll get to.

<h3>clip</h3>
 - This is a dir of spare parts that are weaved into songs.
   Drum clips, bass patterns, arpeggios, chord changes, and styles.


<h3>device</h3>
 - your midi hardware configuration

 - all of syn's samples.  You can always add samples to syn :)
