pianocheetah's softsynth :)
I don't have this fully doc'd yet.  Here's a few hints sigh.


<h3>syn's main config file</h3>
 is at pianocheetah/device/syn/env.txt
There's docs in it, cryptic ones.


<h3>within pianocheetah</h3>
 tracks with a [ suffix set special voice parameters

trackname [vibr.1.2
will set vibrato (pitch oscillation) with envelope's
 - level modulated by x1 control and

 - duration modulated by x2 control


trackname [vibr.1.2 pano.3.4
will have 2 voices per note
 - 1st described above

 - 2nd doing pano (pan oscillation) with envelope controlled by
   x3,x4 controls


These specs are all in Stephenese but you might figure out some stuff from em.
