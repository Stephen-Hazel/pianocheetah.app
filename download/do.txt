octs 1,2 5,6,7   pickable L/R ?
   see what 5+ parts looks like on screen:
      drum, bass, lh, strings/rhythm, rh, voc
revisit old ht cmd and the rest
maybe take out true recording now
allow unsync'd(missed) in play now?
check how ez make sections has same/diff fingering


think/spec______________________________________________________________________

take apart magic singable dumb songs (into .txt?)

syn for a bit - better release (adsr?), try fx, portamento


do2/doc_________________________________________________________________________

backups - php cron to cp dadata/_ => add big/yyyymmdd,   replace bu

redo all .mids to lose $$. junk.  set em in ez mode.  use only syn.

wtf video   prove fun-ness   get buy in
   davin n jannah.  in turret, van, living room.
   with shorty, flashy, rockn88, keytar

why video   theory-ish / pulpit
   we used to play instruments and sing in church and bars and school
      now we don't go to church, school barely teaches anything let alone music
      bars still exist, but just barely
      where oh where are you tonight :)
   screens have wrecked us
      it's time to turn that around.
      time for screens to help us with our stories and songs
   ...88 mechanical switches
      feel = tempo + velocity
      why is piano playin hard
      how is guitar better
      how many people should play a song

how video   cleanin up a song
   name it a.mid in a dir
   addin/removin cues,
   end of song controls makin it go long - can't auto kill em
   editing raw .song with text editor

shazware -
   l  dir arg
      strip n resort by .ext
   doc n package it as app.shaz - flatpak freeware


backlog_________________________________________________________________________

changing device on a track doesn't pick right channel

lhear/lrn modes not doin hear of lrn tracks right sometimes

take out the whole real recording biz!
   ez only recording except for showing all notes
   ht=1,2,L,R,5,6,7
   play melodic tracks with drums :)
   rrr drums for real tho
   won't need rec melo or rec drum tracks

"stutter" in display - due to time div? - even in wayland

wrapping text in tables happens only on 2nd show
   would LIKE to wrap at char instead of word

raspi flatpak

what is messin up sounds back to piano?

StrArr::Add,Ins callers need to USE new bool return code :/

set resolved drum sounds for syn
   (or have song2wav resolve drum sounds)

DrMap list should combine all distinct midiin devtypes' drum.txt's
   unknown drum turns into x128
   should include orig drum in list

ctrl list
   show #events in song.  0 sorted to bottom
   take out tempo?
   preserve across song load
   give controls fullname too

CtlTr - icon centering - it's always just a "decoration role" on left

control editing
   how to edit cues at nearly same time
   when hovering MsPos should find most recent ctl given time
      show it without [+]
      but which track if not global ctl?
      and does Draw do sep lines per track for non global ctls?
   editing tsig,tmpo,ksig

os.h - File::Open(paths/fn,r) - case INsensitive on read
   if open fails  (prob cuz case),
      lowercase the paths/fn and StrCm existing paths/fn to find it to open,r

PcSng Syn::Put bad valu  ch=1 cc=266 valu=226
   LegendOfZelda/_not_rated_130000_Pop_6_19_15_Z_Z_Zelda_-_Legend_of_Zelda_-
   _Bolero_of_Fire_-_Arranged_by_Sinbios'

spurious bug:  sometimes played notes are echoed instead of shushed
               black rec trails show in next cue area
