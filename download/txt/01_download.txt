download pianocheetah app :)
PianoCheetah uses <a pop
 href="https://flathub.org/apps/app.pianocheetah.pianocheetah">flatpak</a>.

 - Search for it in KDE Discover or Gnome Software.

After install, you'll find it in your start menu's <b>multimedia</b> group.

The first time you run PianoCheetah, it'll download a big samples file.  Please
be patient :)
