MIDI - how pianos talk
 It's all the <b>notes</b> and <b>controls</b> that a piano keyboard can send to
 a sound synthesizer over a wire.

Digital pianos have both a keyboard and a built in synthesizer.
 There are also synth keyboards without sound (cheaper)
 that will use a software synthesizer
 on your PC (better).

Anything you can DO on the keyboard, midi can do too.

When you pick a sound, a teeny message goes across the USB midi cable.

When you press a key down, a teeny message goes across midi.

When you release a key, well, you get the idea...


for notes, midi sends:
 - which one?  Octave and note.

 - down or up?  So there are 2 midi events per note.  One down.  One up.

 - how hard pressed/released?  The "velocity" - a number from 1 to 127.  1=soft.
   127=loud.  (0 is used for note off.)

 - which "channel" - a number that ties the note to a particular
   sound and sound controls.  Like a mixer channel but for notes.


for controls, midi sends:
 - which one?  a <i>not very standard</i> id number for
   hold pedal, keyboard pressure, mod wheel, program change, etc.

 - set it to what value?  Usually a number from 0 to 127.

 - which "channel" - again, ties this sound control to the notes playing on
   that channel.


These "midi events" can also be stored in a .mid or .KAR file.
 Events over a wire happen in real time.  In a midi file, these
 events are stamped with the <i>exact</i> time they happen.

These days midi cables are almost always USB.  And connect a keyboard to a PC.
 There are synth modules still.  But most aren't as good as a PC :)

We're only gonna chat about the useful stuff, and try to keep it short.
