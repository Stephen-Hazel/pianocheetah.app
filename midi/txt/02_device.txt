midi devices - computer controlled piano and drums
Midi "devices" can...

 - send out midi when keys are hit and knobs are tweaked -
   a "midi controllers"

 - receive midi and generate a .WAV file or send sound out your speakers -
   a "sound module"

 - or both


A midi controller keyboard sends out note and control messages on a "channel".
 Every device has 16 channels max.  Channel 10 is (usually) dedicated to drums.
 Most controllers send notes out on one channel.
 You can tweak most controllers to do a "split" by messing with the
 (usually terrible) menus on the instrument.
 This sends lower notes out one channel and higher notes out another.
 But, typically a keyboard sends notes out on one channel.

A midi sound module receives midi events and creates audio.
 Usually listening on all 16 available channels.
 Some lame older ones don't do all 16.
 Again, channel 10 is usually a drum channel.
 The other channels (1-9,11-16) are used for melodic sounds.
 All sound modules have a list of available sounds to pick from.  Sometimes
 you can load in new sounds.  Often not.  But the majority let you change the
 sounds with "control change" messages.
