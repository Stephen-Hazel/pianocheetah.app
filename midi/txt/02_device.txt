devices - piano, drums, PC synths
Midi devices can...
 - send out midi when keys are hit and knobs are tweaked -
   a <b>midi controller</b>

 - receive midi and send sound out your speakers (or generate a .WAV file) -
   a <b>sound module</b>.  A PC is great at this.

 - or do <b>both</b> like a digital piano

<h3>midi controller</h3>
 notes and control messages are sent on a <b>channel</b>.

Every device has 16 channels max.
 Except a PC which hooks to lots of devices (with those 16 channels).
 Channel 10 is dedicated to drums.
 Most controllers send notes out on only one channel.

Most controllers can do a "split" by using their (terrible) menus.
 This sends lower notes out one channel and higher notes out another.

But, typically a keyboard sends notes out on one channel.


<h3>midi sound module</h3>
 receives midi events and creates audio.
 A PC is such a thing.
 Usually listening on all 16 available channels.  PCs can listen to multiple
 devices though.

Some lame older sound modules don't do all 16.
 Again, channel 10 is usually a drum channel.
 The other channels are used for melodic sounds.

All sound modules have a list of available sounds to pick from.  Sometimes
 you can load in new sounds.  Sometimes not.
 All let you tweak the sounds with "control change" messages.
