changing how notes sound
<b>control</b> events are sent along midi just like note events.

Let's say you pick an electronic piano sound and use the pitchbend wheel.
 Over midi, you'll see events something like:
<pre>
 Time      Chan Message   Value
 0001.1.001   1 program   4
 0001.1.002   1 noteDown  4c 100
 0001.1.030   1 pitchBend 65
 0001.1.060   1 pitchbend 67
 0001.1.090   1 pitchbend 100
 0001.1.120   1 pitchbend 127
 0001.2.020   1 pitchbend 80
 0001.1.050   1 pitchbend 64
 0001.1.080   1 noteUp    4c 64
</pre>
 - channel<br>
   you used channel 1 and the sound for it was picked with
   a programchange button: 4=electronic piano.

 - control id<br>
   a number matching the midi standard control map is what's actually sent.
   Not a nice little string like "programChange" or "pitchBend".
   But you need to think of control as a name for which control you're tweaking.

 - control value<br>
   usually a number from 0 to 127.
   This value can be interpretted as a signed number (-64 .. 0 .. 63).
   Or a 2 value on/off (0 = off, 64 = on  (or maybe 127 = on)).
   In the case of ProgramChange, the 0..127 maps to one of the standard midi
   sounds...


<h3>What about those control IDs...?</h3>
 There a bunch of different controls.
 And midi is actually only using a little teeny number to identify it.
 Unfortunately, you may need to know what <b>that</b> number is.
 And the midi standard here is terrible across different devices.


<h3>Some common controls are</h3>
 <b>ProgramChange</b> assigns a new instrument (sound) to the channel
<b>MasterTune</b>     tunes all channels of the sound module up or down
<b>Transpose</b>      transposes the notes in a channel up or down
<b>PitchBend</b>      bends the playing notes' frequency up or down
<b>PitchBendRange</b> sets how far "all the way up/down" is in halfsteps
<b>MasterVolume</b>   overall volume for all channels of a device
<b>Volume</b>         setting per channel usually at time=0
<b>Expression</b>     offset to Volume - what a mixer would record
<b>MasterBalance</b>  overall pan for all channels of the sound module
<b>Pan</b>            setting per channel
<b>Balance</b>        offset to Pan - what a mixer would record
<b>HoldPedal</b>      sustain/damper pedal
<b>HoldPedal2</b>     sustain/damper pedal #2
<b>SoftPedal</b>
<b>SustenutoPedal</b>
<b>LegatoPedal</b>
<b>ReverbAmount</b> reverb fx amount - maybe per channel, probably per device
<b>ChorusAmount</b> same deal for chorus fx

<i>Hmmm, what do these do exactly...??</i>
Pressure, ModulationWheel, BreathControl, Pedal,

<i>Hmmm, not all sound modules respond to these...</i>
PortamentoOnOff, PortamentoTime, PortamentoTimeL, PortamentoNote,
 AllSoundsOff, AllControlReset, AllNotesOff, LocalControlOnOff,
 OmniOff, OmniOn, MonoMode, PolyMode

<i>...and there are a lot more</i>

<i>...IT'S A BIG MESS :)</i>

<h3>Control problems</h3>
 What number is it???
People identify controls by name.
 Midi has a very complex numbering method that breaks down controls into
 groups.  Groups that you don't care about.
 If you hear terms like "registered parameter number" or "system common" or
 "system exclusive", well, those are just a <i>lame</i> grouping
 of control numbers :/


<h3>Is it Input or Output?</h3>
 People need to know which slider on the midi controller
 does what on the midi sound module.

When I listed off controls up there...
 You'll note that <i>some</i> have a well defined thing they do on
 the sound module.  (Ex: Pan)
 And some don't.  (Ex: Pedal)

You'll also note that some identify which doodad on the keyboard
 sends em. (Ex: Pedal)
 And some don't. (Ex: Expression)

Notice a pattern here?
 Some controls identify a physical slider or bender or doodad on the keyboard.
 Some identify what happens on the sound module.  Like pan, volume, etc.
 And it's often up to <i>you</i> to make sure these wierd control numbers are
 the <i>right ones</i> all the way through the midi input / sequencer / output
 music recording process...


<h3>How do you do this?</h3>
 Well, PianoCheetah tries to organize them as <i>named</i>
 - Input controls

 - Output controls


<h3>What about the control values?</h3>
 The value a control sends along depends on the type of control...
 There are several kinds of controls on most keyboards.
 - buttons<br>
   one shot:<br>
   some just send values of 64 (maybe 127) when pressed and 0 when released.
   toggle:<br>
   some send a 64 when pressed once, then send 0 when pressed again,
   and then 64 when pressed again, etc...
   note:<br>
   some send note ons and note offs (with or without velocities).

 - pedals<br>
   Some (hold pedals) send only on/off like a one shot button.<br>
   Some (expression pedals) send a value from 0..127.<br>
   Some pedals spring back to 0.  Some stay where you leave em.

 - sliders/wheels/knobs/ribbons<br>
   These usually just send values from 0..127<br>
   Sometimes they spring back to 0.  Sometime they stay put.

 - benders<br>
   These are like sliders, except the value they send is signed.
   It's sending -64 .. 0 .. +63 (which happens to map to 0-127).
   And they usually spring back to 0.

 - keyboard pressure<br>
   when you "lean" on the keyboard while playing notes,
   some keyboards send "keyboard pressure" also known as
   "channel pressure" or "mono aftertouch".
   A value of 0 (not pressed down) to 127 (leaning HARD on it).

 - note pressure<br>
   this is technically part of a note.
   This is a per channel per <b>note</b> control that does <i>something</i>
   to each individual note on the channel.
   What does it do?  Whatever you configure the sound module to do.
   And that's sound module specific...
   It's <i>very</i> rare to actually find a midi keyboard capable of this.


<b>such a mess! :)</b>
