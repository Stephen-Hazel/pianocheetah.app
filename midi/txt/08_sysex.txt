wtf is THAT?
There's one other type of event that can go across MIDI - the SYSEX event.
Sysex stands for "system exclusive" and is a garbage pile of
 anything else you'ld want to send across the wire.

None of the synth manufacturers can agree to send presets or
 other non note/control info in a standard format.

So each manufacturer(system) has their own(exclusive) way of sending these
 presets, banks, system data, etc, etc.

Ok, enough about sysex.  Try to forget it exists.
