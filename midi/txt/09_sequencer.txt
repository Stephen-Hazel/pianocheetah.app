MIDI starts getting interesting when you introduce a midi
<b>sequencer</b>.

it's PianoCheetah -
 a computer program that sits in between your keyboard controller and
 your sound module.

Some (lame) ones exist on keyboards.  The user interface is <b>TERRIBLE</b> tho.
 and same deal for sound modules.

It records all the midi events coming in,
 Plays (<i>sequences</i> em with "backing tracks" of prerecorded midi events.
 Shows em on the screen in a note/control display.
 Saves and loads the events to a midi file.

Sitting in the middle there, a sequencer can listen to the midi coming from the
 keyboard controller and record it into a "track".

A track is similar to a midi channel, but there's no "16 max" limit on tracks.
 You tell a track to listen to a midi channel (or set of em) and record all
 the notes and controls it hears.

You can...
 - display the tracks' notes on screen

 - save em in a .mid file<br>
   (If you need a .WAV or .MP3,  and use Syn2Wav in the song file picker)

 - load em from a file

 - edit em on screen

 - add auto accompaniment

 - juggle which track has which sound

 - juggle which tracks go to which device / channel

The midi sequencer is what gives the keyboard player the capabilities of a
 whole orchestra.  Well, you know, not a real one...



We're <b>DONE</b> here.
