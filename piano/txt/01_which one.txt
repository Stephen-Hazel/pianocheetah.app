which piano should I get?
Acoustic pianos are magic.  But you gotta hit every key.  <b>No</b> !

<h3>your first keyboard</h3>
I'll recommend any cheap piano with lots of `bg2`controls`:
 - pitch bender and wheels<br>

 - sliders and knobs<br>

 - pedals<br>

They make sounds bend, pan, thin and thicken.  And other <b>super</b> cool
 things.  No need for buttons.  Piano keys do what buttons do better.

This first keyboard will teach you why spending more money on one with premo
 keys is worth it.

But those keyboards <i>never</i> come with very many controls.
 So good job gettin' this one first.  Pianos need friends too.

<h3>premo keys</h3>
let you play softly, smoothly, evenly.
 Playing softly is the `bg2`MOST` important thing !!
 Welll, playing in time is.  But STILL.
 Playing loud is easy.  Playing softly takes practice and skill.

You can rest your hands without hitting keys.
 Holding your hands up introduces tension.
 Tension can damage your tendons - watch for it.

But the main reason is they <i>feeeel</i> so good.

I'd rate the brands by feel in this order:
Kawaii, Yamaha, Nord, Roland, Casio.
Yamaha was the sweet spot for me.
 Kawaii and Nord are pretty spendy.  Casios are <i>clacky</i>.

<h3>Hit a local piano/band store</h3>
don't buy till you <b>feel</b> it.
 Keyboard actions are all different and can't ever change.
 Feel is the <b>most</b> important quality of a keyboard.

Good luck !!
