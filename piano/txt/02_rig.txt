it takes more than just a piano
Face it.  Balancin' 88 keys on your knees will get old fast.
You need more things than just a piano.

<h3>Keyboard Stands</h3>
 - X stands.  Wobbly with a weighted keyboard.  Don't get unless you're poor :/

 - 4 leg metal stands, or Z stands.  Do get.

 - console digital pianos have built in stands.
   Your wife may appreciate the nicer look.

<h3>You'll also want to find a place for</h3>
 - speakers

 - amp/stereo if you don't have powered speakers (with amp built in)

 - piano bench - I just use an office chair.  No arms!

 - headphones.  Or your family will <i>justifiably</i> `c0`kill` you.

 - linux PC (duh)

 - a midi drumkit ??  :)
