keyboard specs
When you look for pianos you'll be bombarded with specs.
 Don't worry about synthesizer stuff - syn will do that.
 Do worry about good controls:

<h3>control input</h3>
<b>keyboard pressure / channel pressure / mono aftertouch</b>
mean the same thing -
 leaning on the keys (as a whole) after they're down can modify the sound
 - `bg4`you want it` !

<b>pitchbend and modulation wheels</b>
pitchbender springs back to the center.  modulation one stays put.
 pitchbender almost always bends the note up and down kinda like a guitar.
 Any control can change the sound however you want, though.
 - `bg4`you want em` !

<b>jack for hold pedal (foot controller)</b>
You usually buy the pedal seperately and it needs to match the
 jack in the keyboard (annoying!).  Some are on/off,
 some have a continuous range.
 - `bg4`you want em` !

<b>program change buttons</b> - for changing the sound
 - `bg0`no neeeed`.  (remember?)

<img src="img/slider.png">
<b>sliders and knobs</b> - (derrr)
 - `bg4`you want em` !

<h3>sound output <img src="img/speaker.gif"></h3>
 - <b>polyphony</b> - how many notes it'll play max - ignore it :)

 - A cheap keyboard won't have sounds.  (but syn does).
   A spendy one <i>`bg2`mayyy`</i> have em.  A good piano sound
   on your spendy keyboard might be worth having.
