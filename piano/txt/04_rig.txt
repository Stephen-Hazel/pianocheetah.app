<h3>Keyboard Stands</h3>
Face it.  Balancin' 88 keys on your knees will get old fast...

There are quite a few varieties of stands.
 Building your own like I did may not be feasible.
 (It takes a while to learn to use a tablesaw, build it's sleds, and learn how
 to NOT chop your fingers off.  Seriously, you DON'T want to chop your fingers
 off building a keyboard stand.  The irony...  Ok, sorry)

 - X stands.  Wobbly with a weighted keyboard.  Don't get.

 - 4 leg metal stands, or Z stands.  Good for gigging.

 - small metal table frame at Ikea or whereever.
   These work good if the stand doesn't need to go anywhere.
   Try to get the keys at acoustic piano height.

 - console pianos have built in stands.
   Your wife may appreciate the nicer look.


<h3>You'll also want to find a place for</h3>
 - speakers

 - amp if you don't have powered speakers (with amp built in)

 - sheet music holder - wide enough to hold 3-5 pages

 - piano bench - I just use an office chair  (No arms)

 - headphones.  Or your family will kill you.

 - PC.  a "2 in 1" laptop.  for extra sounds and PianoCheetah.

 - midi drumkit !!
   You can dink in a little drumtrack with your fingers on the keyboard.
   Or an "8 pads" device, or a real digital drum kit.


You can live without for a while, but you'll eventually need most of these.
