my rig
Here's what I ended up with keyboard-wise...
 Yep, big piano/computer stand in the middle of the living room.
 New digital drum kit in the living room, too.  Yes, I'm single...
 Big huge tv for PC monitor.

I think this is discontinued now.

PianoCheetah's SYN.exe gives me 3 millisec latency audio using .WAV files.
 But I mix in the cp-33's piano and my drum kit's sounds.


Ok, We're done.  Time to go play some music :)
