songs in your fingers
Once you learn a song, you <b>still</b> need to practice it.
 Else it'll slip from your fingers (brain).
 So put your <i>repertoire</i> songs on a weekly rotation and
 your <i>learning</i> ones on daily.


<h3>song arrangements</h3>
 songs come different ways - just a vocal; piano solo; tight rock
 arrangement...  And all the built up complexities.

I know you want to play "piano man" <i>exaaactly</i>
 like Billy Joel.  But there are some difficulties :/

 - sheet music is almost never written by the pop artist

 - it's sheet music :(  annoying !

 - usually simplified for a beginning acoustic piano player sigh

 - the full thing of synthesizers, drums, bass, chords, vocal, effects,
   mix is probably something you won't ever find

For "piano man", we have all the notes :)
But most arrangements will be lacking.



But you can learn to compose!  Let's give that a thought...


<h3>whaaat is a song ?</h3>
It's a poem out loud.  Song.

No need for rhyme.  No need for a singing voice even.  Song.

But usually it's more :)

Lyrics - a poem leads to
 - melody - voice, leads to

 - chords - background notes, lead to

 - bass - bottom <i>felt</i> chord note, leads to

 - drums - for nice pointy rhythms

Most music has the singer dude doin the melody.
 That means it won't be a piano part.

If you're not going to sing, you'll need to sound out the melody.  Take it from
 me - that's fun.  Keep dinking keys till you find em.  Write em down.
 A piano melody ain't that great compared to a voice, though.
 Piano is for chords.  Like guitar.

Some midi files do the vocals on piano.  If you're singing, use those notes
 to get your lyric rhythm perfect then mute em and getta mic.


<h3>stealing</h3>
 ok maybe a tiny lecture.
copying is the most sincere form of flattery.
it's ok.
end of lecture.
