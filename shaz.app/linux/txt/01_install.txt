<b><==menu over there if ya already got it.</b>


<h3>Can you do it?</h3>
 Ooonly if you know...
 - how to use a screwdriver

 - how to connect a little plastic connector

then get a usb stick and - boom - you totally got this.

We're doin kubuntu (the best one).  Others are the exact same deal.


<h3>ready ta go?</h3>
 <i>hooold</i> your horses, cowboy.
 Don't tear out your windows until the new ones arrive.

I keep windows cuz of work (and my mice are Logitech).
Or maybe you game.
 - if your PC has 2 disks - that's the best.<br>
   find the model on your PC's barcode sticker, google it,
   see if it'll hold a 2nd disk,
   get one that'll fit.  Usually an M.2 (below)
   or a SATA (with a lil plastic connector).
   <img src='img/disk.png'>


 - else you'll need a 2nd PC - any old PC


<h3>Don't kill your files</h3>
 Now is the time to buy an external disk and format it EXFAT.
 Not EXT4 or NTFS!  Copy all <i>your</i> files to it.

Backup complete!  and both windows and linux can use it.

<b>Now</b> we are truly <i>ready</i>, cowboy :)


<h3>Setup USB stick</h3>
 Hit <a pop href='https://kubuntu.org/download'>kubuntu.org</a>
 and download it's .iso file.

Put it on a usb stick with <a pop href='https://www.balena.io/etcher/'
 >balena etcher</a> and <b>remember</b> your usb stick's name

Now you need to know the key to hold down during boot to get to the BIOS menu.
 It may show during boot.
 Else google the model on your pc's barcode sticker.

Your keyboard and mouse should be either wired or bluetoothed to a USB stub so
 they're available during boot.
 It may also need to be in a usb port on the front of your PC.


<h3>skip me if you gotta 2nd PC</h3>
 Here's where your screwdriver and plastic connector skills come in.
 - unscrew the case

 - find the 2nd disk connector and put in the new linux disk.

 - disconnect the windows disk.<br>
   else the linux installer gives you options you do <b>NOT</b> want.

Trying to make windows and linux share a disk will be a good test
 of your backup.  NOOO!


<h3>BIOS menu</h3>
 plug in your USB stick - it's time.

hold that key during boot to get into the BIOS menu.
 The menu is different on each PC but not too tricky.
 - turn off fast boot and secure boot

 - pick boot order - so USB boots before your disks<br>
   scoot your usb stick to the top of the list

 - <i>remember</i> the disk names

 - save and exit

Which reboots and runs your USB stick - here we gooo !!


<h3>install linux !!</h3>
 The iso on the usb will take forever and only install a "trial mode" of
 kubuntu.  You still need to double click "install kubuntu" to actually do it.

It'll ask for
 - which language and variant, your wifi and password, yada yada yada...

 - you want "3rd party drivers" and any extra apps

 - when you get to which disk to install on...<br>
   <b>always</b> pick one disk to completely replace.<br>
   Don't make a new partition or add onto a disk.

 - it'll ask you if you're sure about this - Duh linux..

 - it'll ask for a username and password: your 2 initials and <i>letstevein</i>

 - name your PC <b>pengo</b> else the install fails (naw)

 - it'll ask if you wanna type your password at logon (nooo!)

 - another wait but less than that dang .iso.<br>
   then it'll ask to reboot.<br>
   it reminds you to take out the usb stick - no worries.

Ya did it !!  Told ya.

Give yourself a pat on the back and let's put linux to use.


<h3>oh and put the windows disk back in</h3>
 You know how now.

Then hold down that bios key on boot.
 In the disk boot order,
 scoot the linux disk to the top (and some BIOS menus let you
 DISABLE the windows disk).

That's the best way to pick between using linux and windows.
 There's grub - but I hate it so much I can only stand to hit enter.
 I prefer to use the BIOS menu to pick which one aaalways comes up.


ALL DOOONE !!
