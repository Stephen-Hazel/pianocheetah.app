kubuntu tweaks
<b>I LIED</b> - we gotta set settings. Why?  Cuz linux.


<h3>in System Settings app</h3>
 - in Quick Settings tab, pick a theme (the default is good - surprise!)

 - in Mouse & Touchpad / Screen Edges, click the top left little square
   and set it to off - dumb

 - in Sound, test your sound devices

 - in Display & Monitor, you know the drill - fix em.

 - in Wallpapaer, pick Elarun and set Wallpaper type to Image.

 - in Text & Fonts / Fonts, I always bump everything up by 2 points - I'm old

 - in Screen Locking, set to Never

 - in KDE Wallet, disable it with top checkbox

 - in Power Management, set it all <i>oooooff</i>

 - in Software Update, set Automatically, Weekly, After rebooting

 - in Session / Desktop Session, uncheck ask confirmation, set empty session

 - in Animations, come back later and play with these


<h3>toolbar icons <=> favorites menu</h3>
 - right click the toolbar icons you don't want,
   add to favorites, right click it again, unpin from task manager

 - right click the favorites icons you want in toolbar icons (task manager),
   and, you know...

 - right click the toolbar, pick "show panel configuration", set all the things.
   this thing used to be <b>much</b> worse - it still needs work

 - How do you get ooout?  pick "exit edit mode".  Be careful in here - you can
   do things that are painful to put back the way they were :/


<h3>set FlatHub in Discover app</h3>
 - click settings tab  (explanations later on)

 - check "FlatPak"

 - add FlatHub

 - then you'll probably need to reboot sigh<br>
   before you can click Make Default next to flatpak

 - and uncheck Snap


Settings maze is UNLOCKED - yay !
