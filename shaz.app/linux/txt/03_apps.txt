Steve's favorite ones
 Everybody says there are no good applications for linux.  Not true.
 But a little bit true.


<h3>pick applications in Discover</h3>
 Click "all applications", enter these into search, and click install from
 flathub

 - google chrome - der

 - disk usage analyzer - shows what's eatin disk

 - filezilla - best ftp client

 - kolourpaint - mspaint

 - OBS Studio - screen recording - I'll splain it later

 - kdenlive - video editor - ditto


<h3>KDE bundled apps</h3>
 - dolphin - <b>truly great</b> - file explorer

 - system monitor - also great - shows your cpu, disk, running tasks, etc

 - kate - overblown - text editor

 - haruna - super great - video player

 - gwenview - lame - picture viewer

 - elisa - dumb - sound file player

 - spectacle - very nice - screen shotter

Unfortunately, KDE and it's bundled apps are very tweakable.  Steve is not a fan
 of that dumbness.

OK!  All done!  You are freeee of windows update.

If you need it for work, at least now you're getting paid to run it (as you
 should).
