flatpak in CLI
If you're not a command line person, thanks for readin - have fun :)

Else this script turns your flatpaks into <b>short</b> commands.
 Instead of typing those dumb triplets and hoo haw.

<a pop href="fp2sh.html">script</a>

It's in php.  <b>Not</b> gonna explain installin php - sorry.
 But it's easily done manually.  Lemme explain...

It just goes through all your flatpak .desktop files and pulls out <b>exec=</b>
 so run this: <pre>
 grep -i --no-filename 'exec='
      /var/lib/flatpak/exports/share/applications/*.desktop</pre>
There's all your flatpak commands right there!

All ya do is make a tiny lil bash script with a
 <i>proper</i> name to kick it.  For example this line of grep output: <pre>
 Exec=/usr/bin/flatpak run --branch=stable --arch=x86_64
    --command=/app/bin/chrome --file-forwarding com.google.Chrome @@u %U @@
 </pre>
 goes into a script named <b>chrome</b> with the Exec= chopped off.

That should probably be built into flatpak, don't ya think ??
 Not too hard, guyz...

Now you can just go:

 - chrome

 - baobab

 - ned file.txt

 - pcheetah a.song

 - etc
