flatpak in CLI
One last thing if you're a command line person.
 If not then whatta ya dooooin?  Go play with linux :)

I wrote a little script that looks up all your flatpak
 commands and makes a little script so you can rum them from the command line
 with a <b>short</b> command instead of those dumb triplets and hoo haw.

Unfortunately, this script is in php.  And I'm certainly not going to explain
 how to install php - sorry.

But you can also do this manually.  You really only need to do this for the
 commands you neeeed.

This baby looks up the desktop files of flatpak and
 makes some shell scripts in the current dir (be careful!).

Again, excuse my php :)  I just prefer it to python (sorry).

Run this thing in your home dir's bin and it'll make a shell
 script for every installed flatpak with the <b>short</b>
 command name.

So you can just go:

 - chrome

 - pianocheetah

 - ...you get the idea :/
