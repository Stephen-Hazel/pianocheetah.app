flatpak in CLI
If you're not a command line person, then we're aaall done here -
 have fun with linux :)

Else here's a script to look up all your flatpak
 commands and make lil scripts that you can just run
 instead of using those dumb triplets and hoo haw.

<a pop href="fp2sh.html">script here</a>

This really should be built
 into flatpak - there's nothin to it.
 Unfortunately, it's in php and I'm certainly not going to explain
 how to install php - sorry.

But this is easily done manually, too - you really only need it for the commands
 you neeed in CLI.

It looks up the .desktop files of flatpak and
 makes some scripts in the current dir.
 So run this thing in your bin dir.

So you can just go:

 - chrome

 - pianocheetah

 - ...you get the idea :/
