my thoughts on coding on linux
First off, please don't just stick with command line coding.
 Linux needs GUI apps that don't suck.
 Let's talk about what you're gettin into...


<h3>the linux kernel itself</h3>
 is magnificent and goes from one version to the next
 with grace and compatibility.

The problem is that everything above it does <i>not</i>.


<h3>the biggest problem</h3>
 is that the EXT4 filesystem is case sensitive.  That's great
 for the security of servers.  But it falls on application
 developers to make `bg2`A`file.txt and `bg3`a`file.txt behave the
 same for the user.  Most of em <b>don't</b>.
 Still workin on that myself sigh.


<h3>another problem</h3>
 is that distros do paths, packages, and shared libs (DLLs) differently.
 This is called a feature.  It is one.  But it's also a `bg0`bug`.
 Put those differences <i>above</i> common core desktops and shared libs.
 Not <i>into</i> em.

Let's say ya gotta simple c++ app.  You compile it on kubuntu.
 Then ya copy the executable to fedora.  What happens?  Nothing.
 the app won't run with fedora's shared libs.  Your app croaks.


<h3>flatpak</h3>
 is the fancy overblown solution.  Standardizing the shared libs and
 having APIs to call them properly.  No recompile for <i>every</i> distro.

But instead of using the distro's shared libs,
 you have a whole extra set of em for your app.
 Users whine about <i>bloat</i>.
 Older apps will require even more extra sets.
 These extra sets are <b>actually</b> the distro's set and those of old apps.
 Not the <b>one</b> set that can be shared by all modern flatpak apps.
 (ok 2 - cuz GTK and Qt)

I predict that distros will realize flatpak will always be there.
 Build the distro with it!  Old apps should fail until they're recompiled.


<h3>yet another problem</h3>
 with linux desktops and apps is
 the `bg0`ass``bg2`u``bg4`me`ption that you're a sys admin who
 <i>loooves</i> settings.  Tons.

And terrible <i>default</i> settings - I'm lookin at you gimp.
 Instead of using the most common setting as default, the most archaic is
 used.  The very first setting in the history of the app
 (usually a lame one).  Come on.


<h3>and another problem</h3>
 is that linux docs are terrible.  why?  because they're written
 by developers.  aaand do you enjoy writing docs?  yeah.  thought so.


<h3>don't run away!</h3>
 unlike windows' problems, linux's problems are actively being fixed.
 - we used to have xwindows - a display server of the unixes of the 1970s!
   Tons of problems.  But wayland has finally replaced it.

 - we have flatpak now - every app used to be compiled for eeevery distro.

 - the distros <i>have</i> made progress in being more compatible.


That's an ok summary of the bad stuff.
 Now let's talk about your path forward - your development path.


<h3>to code ya gotta</h3>
 - decide between the 2 GUI libs - Qt or GTK.
   I think Qt sucks way less.
   It'll also run on windows - but don't waste your time with that.

 - let's setup your dev environment.<br>
   install qtcreator - done.

ok ok no you're not.
