my thoughts on coding on linux
First off, please don't just stick with command line coding.
 Linux needs GUI apps that don't suck.
 Let's talk about what you're gettin into.
 There are things you need to <i>know</i>.


<h3>the linux kernel itself</h3>
 is magnificent and goes from one version to the next
 with grace and compatibility.

The problem is that everything above it does <i>not</i>.


<h3>the biggest problem</h3>
 is that the EXT4 filesystem is case sensitive.  That's great
 for the security of servers.  But it falls on application
 developers to make `bg2`A`file.txt and `bg3`a`file.txt behave the
 same for the user.  And most developers do <b>not</b>.
 I'm still workin on that myself sigh.


<h3>another problem</h3>
 is that distros do things in an incompatible manner.  This is
 called a feature.  It is one.  But it's a `c0`bug` to me.
 Put those differences <i>above</i> common core desktops.
 Not <i>into</i> the desktops and shared libraries!  (aka DLLs)

Let's say you have a simple command line c++ app.  You compile it on kubuntu.
 What happens when you copy the executable to fedora?  Nothing -
 the app won't run.  The shared libs are different and your app croaks.

Didn't have to be this way.  But it <b>is</b> this way.


<h3>flatpak</h3>
 is the big fancy overblown solution.  Standardizing the shared libs and
 making APIs to call them properly.

The side effect is that instead of using
 the distros shared libs, you have a whole separate set of shared libs for your
 apps - 2 (usually 4+) sets of shared libs.
 Users whine about this, but it's the cost of using older apps needing
 older shared libs.  It's the app that's
 at fault.  <b>And</b> the distro failing to be an operating system.

My prediction is that some day, the distros will finally realize that flatpak
 will always be above them.  So why not USE those shared libs to build the
 distro and quit forcing an extra set of shared libs on the user.

Then the need for flatpak will go away because there now <b>WILL</b> be a common
 set of shared libs for app developers to use.  And older apps will fail until
 they're recompiled (as they should).


<h3>yet another problem</h3>
 with linux desktops and apps is
 the `bg0`ass``bg2`u``bg4`me`ption that you're a sys admin who
 <i>loooves</i> settings.  Tons.  Think android settings times 2,048.

And terrible <i>default</i> settings - I'm lookin at you gimp.
 Instead of using the most common setting as default, the most archaic is
 used.  The very first setting in the history of the app
 (usually a lame one).  Come on.


<h3>and another problem</h3>
 is that linux docs are usually terrible.  why?  because they're usually written
 by developers.  aaand do you enjoy writing docs?  yeah.  thought so.


<h3>don't run away!</h3>
 unlike windows' problems, linux's problems are actively being fixed.
 - we used to have xwindows - an ancient display server of unix.
   Tons of problems.  There's finally a modern replacement - wayland.

 - we have flatpak now - every app used to be compiled for eeevery distro.

 - the distros <i>have</i> made progress in being more compatible.


That's an ok summary of the bad stuff.
 Now let's talk about your path forward - your development path.


<h3>to code ya gotta</h3>
 - decide between the GUI libs - Qt or GTK.
   I think Qt sucks way less.
   It'll also run on windows - but don't waste your time with that.

 - let's setup your dev environment.<br>
   qtcreator from flatpak via Discover - yer done.<br>
   ok ok no you're not.  But I got you - let's talk about using flatpak :)
