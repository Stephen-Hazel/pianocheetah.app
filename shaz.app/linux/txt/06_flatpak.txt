your app on all linuxes
There are 2 other sucky ways - snap (by canonical - meh) and
 appimage (poorly supported).  FlatPak is the one you want.

Like me, you're probably thinking <i>whyyy do i gotta learn this dumb thing</i>?
 But, in the end, ya just gotta.  Blame the distros and get on with it.

FlatPak is <i>well</i> designed and pretty well documented on
 <a pop href="https://docs.flatpak.org/en/latest/">flatpak.org</a>.
 Read it later.  Lemme summarize it first.
 But it does have details you'll need.

And there's
 <a pop href="https://flathub.org/en?category=popular">flathub.org</a>
 The site holding your installer.  It has a lot of picky requirements,
 but I got you.

End users actually install from
 - KDE discover app

 - gnome software app


<h3>flatpak's main deal</h3>
 is that your app links to a standard set of shared libs provided
 by a <b>flatpak runtime</b> -
 a <i>standardized, versioned</i> set of shared libs.
 You'll pick kde/gnome (Qt/GTK) and which version.


<h3>your app triplet</h3>
 app names must not conflict.  Via an annoying reverse URL setup.
 If my website is https://shaz.app and my app is pianocheetah, it must be named
 - app.shaz.pianocheetah

Not great.  But, eh, not terrible.


<h3>permissions</h3>
 Flatpak executables run in a pseudo-sandbox.
 The idea is to protect the user from malicious apps.

Seems unnecessary to me.  You're running it on your PC.  If you don't trust
 it, why is it there??

In the end, your app must specify lots of permissions that every app needs.
 Yes my app uses graphics.  Why?  Because it's an app.  Come on flatpak.


<h3>special directories</h3>
 One nice thing is that your app has a "virtual" directory all to itself.
 An install and config directory - all your's :)

When your app runs, the binaries are at <i>virtual</i> directory

 - /app/bin/<i>whatev_app</i>

And your config files go into

 - /var/config/<i>whatev.conf</i>

Those files are persisted in the user's home dir at:

 - /home/user/.var/app/app-triplet/<i>etc-etc-etc</i>

If you want to see your app's runtime layout, here's how to
 enter the "virtual world" that your app sees

 - flatpak run --command=sh <i>app_triplet</i>

<pre>
 [app.shaz.pianocheetah app]$ cd /app/bin
 [app.shaz.pianocheetah bin]$ ls -al

These directory paths only exist while the flatpak exes run.
 This will mean a minor rewrite to some of your code.
 If you start other executables that are part of the flatpak,
 you'll need to system() them in
 - /app/bin/whatever_exe

And when you write config files,
 no more ~/.config/my_package/my_conf.conf -
 you'll need to path to
 - /var/config/my_conf.conf


<h3>Let's git started</h3>
 First thing is your <b>manifest</b>.  A .json file that specs:
 - app triplet

 - which flatpak runtime (gtk/qt and which version)

 - your app permissions can't just be "default" sigh.

Here's <a pop href=''>mine</a>.  I use c++ and qt6.

 My permissions include --filesystem=host.
 If I used filesystem=home, flatpak turns
 - paths in your home dir into some pretty terrible softlinks
   that I don't want to deal with or have my users see.

You'll see most of those permissions just spec what <i>eeevery</i> app will
 need.  I have a common set of .cpp and .h files in
 a dir called "stv" that my code uses.
 Qt uses a cmake-ninja kinda make.  It uses your CMakeList.txt to build each
 executable.

The first "module" is my .desktop and icon files.
 and an "appdata" file about my program with screenshots, etc.
 The flatpak docs explain that gory stuff.

That's all the explanation you get - sorry.

The main docs are good, but skimpy.

My script to actually run the build (please excuse my php)
is <a pop href="b">here</a>

<h3>build dirs</h3>
Ok that build script looked a little ugly (i mean, it is php).
Let's talk about the flatpak build and release process.

 - build dir - this is where flatpak-builder
   (which you'll need to apt install) writes your executables, etc.

 - repo dir - this is a dir you can distribute/install your app from.
   It might be an actual git repo.  Not sure :/

 - .flatpak-builder - a cache dir holding previous builds -
   I usually just wipe it.

<h3>distribute manifest</h3>
Here's my distribute manifest - much simpler :)
<a pop href="app.pianocheetah.pianocheetah.json">here</a>.

And my build script can be given an o argument to stop
 upon making the build diretory for flathub.
 Then I make a pull request on flathub's repo and
 add my build dir and the release manifest.

All the release manifest does is take the binaries and
 desktop/icon/appdata and put em in a flatpak repo.
 Then upon the flathub guys doin' their thing, it shows up on flathub :)

Ok!

One last problem flatpak has is
 - how do I run flatpaks from the command line ???

I got your answer...
