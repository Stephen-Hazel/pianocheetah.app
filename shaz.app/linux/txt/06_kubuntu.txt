installing kubuntu
You need to know the key to hold down during boot that gets you into your
 bios settings.  Sometimes it shows during boot.

If not, find your PC's barcode sticker, get the PC model and google it.

Make sure your keyboard is wired or bluetoothed to a USB stub thing.
 It may need to be a usb port on the front of your PC.

hit <a pop href='https://kubuntu.org/download'>kubuntu.org</a>
 and download it's iso

put it on a usb stick with https://www.balena.io/etcher/

hold that key to
 - turn off fast boot
 - turn off secure boot
 - pick boot order so USB boots before your disk(s)
 - and reboot :)

The iso on the usb will install a "trial mode" of kubuntu.

You still need to double click the big ole "install kubuntu"
 to actually do that.

It'll ask for which language and variant (English British or American?),
 your wifi and password, etc.

 - Then you get to which disk to install on with lots of possibilities.

 - Don't make a new partition or add onto a disk !!

 - <b>ALWAYS</b> pick one disk to completely replace.  Don't try to force
   linux on the same disk as windows.  Windows will very likely eat it :(

 - answer <i>yessss</i> to <b>DO YOU REALLY WANNA KILL ALLA DATA ON THERE ??</b>

 - it'll ask for a username and password and if you wanna type your password at
   logon (nooo!) and if you want extra stuff (sure go for it).

 - ok.  wait for a bit.  then it'll ask to reboot.  and it'll remind you to take
   out the usb stick - no worries.

Ya did it !!  All done with the install.

Now we setup kubuntu - doubleclick <b>System Settings</b> on the toolbar
 - in Quick Settings tab, pick a theme.  The default is pretty solid.

 - in Mouse & Touchpad / Screen Edges, click the top left little square
   and set it to off - that's dumb

 - in Sound, check your sound device

 - in Display & Monitor, you know the drill - check your monitors.

 - in Wallpapaer, pick Elarun and set Wallpaper type to Image.

 - in Text & Fonts / Fonts, I always bump everything up by 2 points - I'm old

 - in Screen Locking, set to Never

 - in KDE Wallet, disable it with top checkbox

 - in Power Management, set it all <i>oooooff</i>

 - in Software Update, set Automatically, Weekly, After rebooting

 - in Session / Desktop Session, uncheck ask confirmation, set empty session

 - in Animations, come back later and play with these

 - right click the toolbar icons you don't want,
   add to favorites, right click it again, unpin from task manager

 - right click the favorites icons you want on the task manager and, you know...

 - right click the toolbar, pick "show panel configuration", set all the things,
   pick "exit edit mode".
   (this used to be way worse but still needs improvement sigh)

Ok!  All tweaked!  Now we install apps - we use that Discover app
 - click settings tab

 - check "FlatPak"

 - add FlatHub

 - then you'll probably need to reboot before you can<br>
   click Make Default and

 - uncheck Snap

Now click "All Applications" and enter these into search and click install
 - google chrome
 - disk usage analyzer - shows what's eatin disk
 - filezilla - ftp client
 - kolourpaint - mspaint
 - OBS Studio - screen recording - we'll get to that
 - kdenlive - video editor - we'll get to that
