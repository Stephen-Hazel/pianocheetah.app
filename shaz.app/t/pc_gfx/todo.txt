Do you have a few example screens of that specific colouring? Also, to make it perfect, a few more questions:

Do you like the new icon shapes?
The octave - what exact size is needed?

Could you also tell me more about your idea of zooming in the end of the usb for midicfg, please?



phase1:

I like the overall style and shapes !

But I was specific about "icons should be colored - not monochrome".

Please make everything 32x32 but the 2 app icons should have an extra 24x24 resolution.  Enlarged pics - no need heheh.

Flipping to another icon for dark mode is no problem for me.  And I can
just duplicate the ones that look good both ways.

Specifics...

view/hand type:
My apologies - I wasn't very specific in my specs.
This is actually 3 icons :/  An eye to show you want to just SEE the
notes of the track or RH/LH for actually playing the notes of the track
I really like the RH,LH.  But one more eye please - you're good at eyes
from your examples.

octave:
See this (existing) octave bitmap - black notes and white notes must line up underneath it.  If you could take this and clean up the colors/shading that's kind of what I need.  Restyling it would be great, too - but it must fit pixel perfect because my notes are an exact pixel width.
I draw the colored squares (notes of the scale) and octave #s on top so none of that junk in the bitmap.  Most pianos have a red felt strip at the top of the keys.  Ideally black key width within the octave matches
my black notes below it.

hear/play/practice:
Can these please go back to my original picks of ear/finger/brain?
But stylized better - I just drew those minus the brain i found.
(problem being headphones aren't used in piano practice, keys are too generic, metronomes are way too old school).  I know this is me limiting your creativity but, mmm, i gotta here...

The rest are very good !
I like the settings, the view and hands are pretty solid - nice.
And the app icons are a great start - if the cool note looks good colored
at 32x32 I'm on board :)  Maybe zoom in on the end of the usb or something for midicfg?


background:
   These are my specs but YOU are the designer and
      I expect you to change my ways.  Please tell me of better options!

   I expect you to deliver knowledge to me, too - not just icons :)

   I'm on Kubuntu - KDE desktop on ubuntu
      (ubuntu is derived from debian) sitting on the drivers of linux.
      I use the Qt library to display my windows, dialogs, toolbars, etc.

?     Any chance you could try kubuntu :)
         instructions on https://shaz.app/linux


overall format:
   I like icons with no borders and a transparent background.
      No fluff - fluff takes up valuable space.

   The icons should be colored - not monochrome.

   resolution:
      I just found a way to make my app use 32x32 for toolbar icons today!
         24x24 is the default.
      My app window icon depends on my screen resolution so
         it's 24x24 unless I start using 4K.
?     What are your thoughts on resolution?

      KDE linux/Qt GUI scale things down, but never up.

   format:
      Qt is fine with ico, png, jpg, most anything I think.
      oh and .svg too.  I like the IDEA of svg cuz it's text and vectored.
      I've generally gone toward .png
?     Again, what are your thoughts on format?


how to start:
   From a coding standpoint I'd prefer one set of icons that look good in
      both dark and light modes.
      What do designers think of this?  Too limiting?  Fewer color choices?
      I'm not an expert - tell me things.
      Will 2 sets give me much more beautiful and COOL icons?

?  What are your thoughts about distributing your work sigh.
      pianocheetah is open source.
      there's been no interest, i could close source it (again).
      I don't want to give your work away unless you're ok with that.


phase 1 overall:
   skip arrow icons and play control icons - think about those for phase 2.

   skip little used icons or "I'm not sure that function is done" icons.

   concentrate on app icons and the ones picked with * below

   start talking about my oct.png - it has many subtleties
      must be choppable, joinable, small

   when you feel we're done with phase 1, we'll go on to 2 :)


phase 2 initial:
   arrow and play control finesse and
   general help with my track view and notes view.


deeeeeeetails...


app icons:
   MidiCfg
      is only a separate app from PianoCheetah due to it's complexity :/
      It picks which midi devices you have, names them, orders them,
         troubleshoots if they're listening, etc.

      I like the idea of using an old school midi cable icon.
      But I'm not married to it.
?     please help :)

   PianoCheetah
      you've seen my website docs.  Generally it lets you pick tracks of a song
      to play in a simplified manner.

      I'd like to have a cheetah in the icon.  But that's asking a lot, I think.
      I don't think I've ever seen a cheetah icon eeever.

      So I've fallen back to an eighth note.  Which is pretty good, but also
      kinda generic.  Maybe just a nicely styled COOL eighth note would do it.

?     But you're the creative one :)  Find somethin to dazzle me :)



assets list:
   * means please make it  (after a little chattin about it)
   " means a dup of one already picked

   background:
      I generally use =12= colors by splitting hue into 12 and using same
      saturation and value across the 12.

      my notes are little dig dug guys (if you remember the old video game daze)
         I'm kind of married to em but also want a professional opinion.
